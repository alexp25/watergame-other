Advantages:
K-means: Much faster than DBSCAN and OPTICS.
DBSCAN: No number of clusters needed
OPTICS: No number of clusters needed. Identifies clusters with different densities.

Disadvantages:
K-means: Estimated of number of clusters required
DBSCAN: Does not work well over clusters with different densities
OPTICS: Slower than DBSCAN
