To build a collaborative filter recommender system, you can follow the following steps:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Calculate the mean consumption for each user and source in the training set.
Calculate the deviation of each consumption value from its respective mean in the training set.
Calculate the similarity between users based on their consumption patterns. A common metric for similarity is the cosine similarity.
For each user and source in the testing set, find the K most similar users and calculate the weighted average of their deviations from the mean consumption for that source. The weights are the cosine similarities between the users.
Add the weighted average to the mean consumption for that user and source to get the recommended consumption value.
